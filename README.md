# Nonlinear-Observer

The tasks are to design nonlinear observers by using contraction analysis to estimate velocity of a nonlinear system.

In this task, the measurable position is assumed to be x,and it's used to estimate velocity,x_dot, called x_hat_dot.

The result shows that it accurately estimates velocity and a controller design based on the measureable position and estimated velocity is able to stablize the system.
